## Description
This page allows users to check their real-time location and visualize it on an interactive map using the Leaflet library. It also enables users to draw areas on the map to verify if they are inside them.

## Features
- **Real-time location display**: Shows the user's latitude and longitude.
- **Draw areas on the map**: Users can define zones using two methods:
  - **Freehand Drawing**: Draw freely with the cursor.
  - **Point Selection**: Define points manually to form a polygon.
- **Location verification within an area**: If the user is inside the drawn area, an indicator turns green; otherwise, it turns red.
- **Additional tools**:
  - Center the map on the user's location.
  - Delete drawn areas.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for structure and functionality.
- **Leaflet.js** for interactive map management.
- **OpenStreetMap** as the map provider.
